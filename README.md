# Recursive optimizers

The purpose of this project is to implement a number of niche recursive optimizers in a modular way, such that they can be easily interchanged in code. 

# Disclaimer
This library should not be used in production code, as it is a personal project from a recent graduate trying to learn to do more low-level machine learning C++ programming.
